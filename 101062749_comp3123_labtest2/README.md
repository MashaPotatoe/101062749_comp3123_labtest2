Here is my React JS lab test 2

My API calls the user list and you are able to click on the name to go to the albums.
You can also navigate to albums through the header.

You can search dynamically through the albums. 
I used axios and fetch to get the APIs. 

My biggest challenge was clicking on the user and getting the album information. I wasn't able to do it. It's supposed to be connected through the userId, unfortunately I wasn't able to get this.
